🤖 Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This notebook demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs). It blends the simplicity of pre-trained models with the power of natural language understanding to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments with high accuracy.

📘 Project Overview

Traditional sentiment analysis methods (like bag-of-words or rule-based systems) often fall short when dealing with nuanced, context-rich text. This project leverages transformer-based LLMs to overcome these limitations and provide context-aware sentiment classification.

🧠 What’s Inside
	•	📥 Dataset Preprocessing
Cleaned and tokenized textual data using robust NLP libraries to ensure compatibility with the chosen LLM.
	•	🔮 Model Selection
Integrated state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT-based models) using Hugging Face Transformers for high-accuracy sentiment classification.
	•	📊 Sentiment Classification
Applied the model to infer sentiment labels from various types of text inputs including tweets, reviews, and custom phrases.
	•	📈 Performance Metrics
Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to benchmark performance.
	•	🎨 Visualizations
Included confusion matrix and sentiment distribution charts for a better understanding of the model’s predictions.
